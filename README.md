FamApp

This is the fifth project for Udacity’s iOS Nanodegree Course. This iOS app is a prototype for a family social app which allows family members to send messages to one another, track one anothers’ location on a map and
share details of upcoming events on a calendar.

The app comprises four main views: the Members View, which lists the members using the app, the Messaging View, The Map View and the Calendar View.  

The Calendar uses Mozharovsky’s CVCalendar Library in GitHub (with permission under the MIT License), which was modified accordingly for this application.
